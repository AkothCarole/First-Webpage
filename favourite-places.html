      <li>Morocco</li>
      <p>
        Disparate cultures converge in Morocco, where European, Arab, and African influences make for a country like no other.
        Whether you're frequenting the food stalls in Marrakech, gawking at Islamic architecture like Hassan II Mosque,
        or trekking your way across the Sahara Desert, you'll find something new and exciting there

      <li>Ireland</li>
      <p>
        It's Ireland. You know, the place that practically invented drinking whiskey.
        But if you don't find yourself melting into a pub stool. You can traverse the 26,000 acres of woodland at Killarney National Park,
        and soak in the view of scenic mountains and lakes; or visit Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, where 40,000 basalt stones remain after an old volcano eruption.
